# TODO

Just reminders here

## Features

Add acl. So that if an ACL exists, then broadcast aren't used
only acl members can send messages in and outgoing messages
will be encrypted to all members. So - private actor, basically

## Bugs

### Bootstrap peers

Make a list of host, ie. Multiaddrs or nodeIds configurable, so that these
are all that's required for a successful bootup.

### Connect

Add a connect command to connect to a specific host directly, eg:

/connect relay
