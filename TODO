# TODO

Just reminders here

## Features

### ACL

Add acl. So that if an ACL exists, then broadcast aren't used
only acl members can send messages in and outgoing messages
will be encrypted to all members. So - private actor, basically

### merge aliases

In terms of actors, the alias should be merged. Maybe to a did@node
There should be some correlation. did@node is farily correct.
Maybe publish node to DIDDocument? Eg, "lastKnownNode"

This should be set manually. We can't really know this. Maybe we can
trace the node, though ... all interestin. Trace where messages where
sent from.

## Bugs

/WHen setting a nick to an existing nick the message is OK, not an error. The change doesn√¶t go through, as is correct.

### Bootstrap peers

Make a list of host, ie. Multiaddrs or nodeIds configurable, so that these
are all that's required for a successful bootup.

### Connect

Add a connect command to connect to a specific host directly, eg:

/connect relay

### Pinning
We should probably handle pinning. Maybe not for DID Docs, as they have timestamp, so wont be reused.
