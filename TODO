## Bugs

### Broadcast

There is no way to broadcast a message at this time. Either
it should be able to differ between and encrypted and signed missages,
or each actor should have a stream connection to the room.

The latter is the better, because it doesn't leak and only uses established
streams, so no sending to dead actors.

Messages over streams are already encrypted, so no need to reencrypt.
Just sign messages. A special recipient, eg. "broadcast" or a special
MIME type message could be sent to everybody.

Maybe secret messages should be sent as envelopes, but only broadcasts
should be sent over streams? This way only the actual lines of text
need be sent.

### Decayer

The routing table is not well handled and a little too flaky.
I don't understand the decayer, but'll look at it later. For now protect
recognized hosts

### Pong broadcast

Pong should keep a list of respondents and ping them all. The list should
be cached and ever so often the lastKnownLocation should be looked up and
the non-present entries be deleted.

It doesn't matter if we send a few lost messages, but we shouldn't overdo it.

### Bootstrap peers

Make a list of host, ie. Multiaddrs or nodeIds configurable, so that these
are all that's required for a successful bootup.

#### Connect

Add a connect command to connect to a specific host directly, eg:

/connect relay
