Just reminders here

## Features

### ACL

Add acl. So that if an ACL exists, then broadcast aren't used
only acl members can send messages in and outgoing messages
will be encrypted to all members. So - private actor, basically

## Bugs

Nicks are reset every startup.

### Pinning
We should probably handle pinning. Maybe not for DID Docs, as they have timestamp, so wont be reused.
